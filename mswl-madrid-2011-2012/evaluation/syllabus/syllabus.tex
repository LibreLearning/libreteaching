\section{Grading plan}

Each activity contributing to the grading of the course has its own evaluation criteria, 
as described below. Each of these activities has a minimum and maximum grading. If the 
minimum grading is 0, the activity is optional. Otherwise, the activity is mandatory, 
and has to be graded at least with the minimum to pass the course. Each activity has 
also a description, and when possible, some general grading criteria. In any case, 
the final grade for the course will also depend on the continuous observation of the 
instructors on the outcomes and progress of students.

Students should ask instructors about any detail which may not be clear to them, either 
about the general grading plan, or about specific aspects of the activities. As a general
 rule, evaluation will have into account how the activity and its results show that the 
student has come close to the competences, knowledge and skills expected for the course.

The student can consider that the next table will be used as a (minimum) guideline for 
assigning marks:

\begin{itemize}
\item Pass (``aprobado''): 120
\item Good (``notable''): 250
\item Excellent (``sobresaliente): 350
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Exercises (answered in forum)}. \\
  Minimum: 30 points, maximum: 100 points.

  Exercises proposed and answered in the the forum of the course.

\item \textbf{Blog entries}. \\
  Minimum: 20 points, maximum: 80 points

  Blog entries specifically related to the course, and marked as such. The tag used for that is mswl-eval.

\item \textbf{Case Study - Libre SCM Tools: Bazaar, Mercurial and Git}. \\
  Minimum: 50 points, maximum: 100 points

\item \textbf{Other activities}. \\
  Minimum: 0 points, maximum: 100 points

\end{itemize}
