``Mathematical books and journals do not look as 
beautiful as they used to. It is not that their 
mathematical content is unsatisfactory, rather that 
the old and well-developed traditions of typesetting 
have become too expensive. Fortunately, it now appears 
that mathematics itself can be used to solve 
this problem.''
