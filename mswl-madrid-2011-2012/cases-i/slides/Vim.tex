\item The name vi is derived from \textit{visual in ex}
\item 1979. Mark Horton added support for function keys, macros...
\item 1983. Vi was added to Bell Labs System V
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Why vi?}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why vi?}

\begin{itemize}
\item The Single UNIX Specification specifies vi, so every conforming system must include it
\item Runs on all systems that can implement the standard C library
\item 2009. A survey of Linux Journal readers found that vi was the most widely used text editor among respondents (36\%)
\item Small and fast
\item Editor War!
