\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item FLOSS history and Computer science history are very parallel.
\pause
\item Because, in the beginning, first computers always were ``open sourced''.
\pause
\item For example, in the 60s, software was acompanying hardware, and source code could be modified by anyone...
\pause
\item ... and shared with others.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item In these days, some scientists appeared, related with first commercial computers.
\pause
\item Engineers and physicists appeared with high interests in ``how it works''.
\pause
\item These people were truly entusiasts, people which created and modified software for enjoying them.
\pause
\item These were called ``real programmers''.
\item ``A brief history of hackerdom'', Eric S. Raymond.

\frametitle{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Since these days to today, FLOSS culture (and technology) evolution has been always driven by some people.
\pause
\item People with name and surname which have contributed something crucial for that moment.
\pause
\item These people will be called by us ``{\bf FLOSS Leaders}''.

\frametitle{Overview of this unit}
\begin{itemize}
\item In this unit, we will see, in historical order, some key people in libre software field.
\item This unit will be organised in an interactive manner:
\item First, we will give you some names and photographs...
\item ... and you will be the responsible of investigate all about them.
\item The exercises will consist in, preparation of a slides presentation with the information you have investigated.
