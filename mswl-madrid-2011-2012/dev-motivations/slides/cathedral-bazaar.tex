\section{Introducing the paper}

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Eric Steven Raymond}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2cm]{figs/EricrRaydmon.jpg}
\end{center}


\begin{itemize}
\item December 4, 1957
\item Fetchmail, gpsd, emacs editing modes
\item "The Cathedral and the Bazaar", published in 1997 -> Became a prominent voice in the open source movement 
\item Co-founded the Open Source Initiative in 1998

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Origins}

\begin{itemize}
\item First version of the paper written in 1997.
\item Several revisions published until 2000.
\item The author unveils a ``development model'' through the history
  of the Linux kernel and one of his own tools.
\item This model is presented as revolutionary, since it is useful to
  build large systems without apparently any or few organization at all.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The models}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf The Cathedral}: The ``classic'' model.
\begin{itemize}
\item Closed environment.
\item Small group of leaders/developers.
\item Only ``stable'' releases on, in some cases, ``betas''.
\item Used both in classic development models, such as waterfall, spiral etc;
  and classic FLOSS projects.
\item Examples: GCC, GNU Emacs.
\end{itemize}

\item {\bf The Bazaar}: The model introduced by Linus Torvalds.
\begin{itemize}
\item Open environment, almost any person can participate.
\item There are no clear leaders, undefined number of developers.
\item However, there is a benevolent-dictator figure.
\item ``Release early, Release often''.
\item Examples: Linux.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The surprise}

The Bazaar style of development:
\begin{itemize}
\item with a community seemed to resemble a large babbling bazaar of
  diverse agendas and approaches
\item with archive repositories where anyone can propose a
  modification
\item but from this, a stable and coherent large system emerges.
\end{itemize}

This was surprising:
\begin{itemize}
\item Why Linux did not fly apart in confusion...?
\item ...and why Linux seemed to go from strength to strength at a speed
  barely imaginable to cathedral-builders?
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\section{The Lessons}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lesson 1}

\begin{center}
{\large Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's
  personal itch.}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item Most successful free software projects have been started by developers
with needs addressed by their ``pet'' project.
\item In the world of proprietary software, programmers spend their
  time building programs that they neither need nor want.
\item This motivation could explain the high quality of results given
  by Linux.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lesson 2}

\begin{center}
{\large Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to
  \textit{rewrite} (and reuse).}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item Linus Torvalds did not try to write Linux from scratch. Instead,
  he started by reusing Minix code and ideas.
\item Although today all
  reused Minix code has been removed or rewritten, while it was there,
  it provided scaffolding for the infant that would eventually become
  Linux.
\item The source-sharing tradition of the Unix world has always been
  friendly to code reuse.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lesson 3}

\begin{center}
{\large ``Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.''}
\end{center}
from chapter 11, The Mythical Man-Month, by Fred Brooks.

\begin{itemize}
\item We really do not understand the problem, until the first
  implementation is done.
\item So if you want to get it right, be ready to start over at least once.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lesson 4}

\begin{center}
{\large If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item Eric's problem was that he needed a POP protocol client to work
  with.
\item And he found an abandoned one.
\item The problem was the continuation of the abandoned client, and
  Eric took it over and started to coordinate it.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lesson 5}

\begin{center}
{\large When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item Before abandoning the development of a free software,
  we should find another person to continue its development.
\item Fortunately, in the bazaar world, some other hacker will find
  your abandoned work soon, and will start to develop it for his own
  needs.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lesson 6}

\begin{center}
{\large Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item In Linux, some users are also hackers.
\item Thanks to source code availability, these users can be {\em
    effective} hackers.
\item This can be useful for shortening debugging time.
\item These users will diagnose problems, suggest fixes, and help in
  improvements.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lesson 7}

\begin{center}
{\large Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item This is another Linux characteristic: during very active
  development periods, lots of versions were released.
\item Sometimes, more than one in a day.
\item This maintains the hackers constantly stimulated and rewarded:
\item stimulated by the prospect of having an ego-satisfying piece of the action,
\item and rewarded by the sight of constant (even daily) improvement
  of their work.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lesson 8}

\begin{center}
{\large Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost
  every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix becomes obvious to
  someone.}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item ``Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.'' (named ``Linus's
  Law'' by Eric S. Raymond).
\item Somebody finds the problem, and somebody else understands (and
  fixes) it.
\item The differences between the cathedral and the bazaar: In the
  cathedral-builder view of programming, bugs and development problems
  are tricky, insidious, deep phenomena.
\item In the bazaar, bugs are generally shallow phenomena (they turn
  shallow when exposed to a thousand eager co-developers collaborating
  in next release).
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lesson 9}

\begin{center}
{\large Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than
  the other way around.}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item It is difficult to understand the code written by others,
\item but when we understand the data structures, understanding the
  code is easier.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lesson 10: Eric tries the model}

Eric S. Raymond tries successfully the model, with the following
principles:
\begin{itemize}
\item Releasing early and often.
\item Adding everyone who contacted him about the
  implemented program to the beta list.
\item Announcing new releases to the beta list, stimulating people to
  participate.
\item Listening to beta-testers, polling them about design decisions
  and taking in consideration patches and other feedback from them.
\end{itemize}

The consequence:
\begin{center}
{\large If you treat your beta-testers as your most
  valuable resource, they may become that, eventually.
}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lessons 11 and 12}

\begin{center}
{\large The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good
  ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
{\large Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from
  realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item Eric learned this when saw good ideas for his application
  suggested by users.
\item These ideas helped him to understand that, initially, he was
  looking the solution for the wrong problem.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lesson 13}

\begin{center}
{\large ``Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.''}
\end{center}
by Antonie de Saint-Exupery.

\begin{itemize}
\item When the code is getting both better and simpler, that is when
  we know it is right.
\item At this moment, the software maintained by Eric was, not only
  very different, but also simpler and better. It was time to change
  its name and give it its new identity: ``fetchmail'' instead of
  ``popclient''.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lessons 14, 15}

\begin{center}
{\large Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly
  great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
{\large When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to
  disturb the data stream as little as possible -- and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!.}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lessons 16, 17}

\begin{center}
{\large When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic
  sugar can be your friend.}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
{\large A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of
  pseudo-secrets.}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item These are lessons learned directly from the concrete
  application: {\em fetchmail}. Not related with SE.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lessons 18, 19}

\begin{center}
{\large To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem
  that is interesting to you.}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
{\large Provided the development coordinator has a communications
  medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead
  without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

\section{Criticism}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Criticism}

\begin{itemize}
\item No scientific rigor (it is an essay).
\item Based on anecdotal evidences (not a systematic study).
\item Raymond tries to generalize the case of Linux to all free
  software projects.
\item Some critics say that Linux is, in fact, an example of cathedral
  process: there is a leader, and a hierarchic structure of people
  with delegated tasks. Also, responsibilities are distributed in that
  structure although not explicitly.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Criticism}

\begin{itemize}
\item Free Software == Bazaar?
\begin{itemize}
\item Is there one development model for free software?
\item Are all projects really built from many contributions of *many*
  developers?
\end{itemize}
\item Bazaar definition may not be accurate.

\item Free Software is not actually a bazaar.

\begin{itemize}
\item Free software is software released with the four freedoms.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{A Second Look at the Cathedral and the Bazaar (Nikolai Bezroukov)}

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{Brooks Law still apply to Internet-based distributed development}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Internet only increases the quality of the pool of developers
	\end{itemize}

\item \emph{Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow}
\item \emph{Does Linux belongs to the Cathedral model or to the Bazaar model?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A not so democratic Bazaar
		\item Kernel core Cathedral?
	\end{itemize}

\item Does OSS development model automatically yield the best results?

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
