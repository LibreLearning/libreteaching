\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Why training about FLOSS?
\item Ignorance about FLOSS
\item People unwilling to change technologies (specially at work)
\item To explain, to aware, to show the way instead of to enforce
\item To mitigate downtime and reject to change (futz time)
\item Becareful with FUD
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{DownTime}
\begin{itemize}
\item Time the technology is not working or is not usable (blue screen?)
\item Learn how to use it correctly. New technology could cause increases in downtime because of ignorance and bad use
\item Could we say FLOSS provides better performance? Study each scenario
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Futz factor}
\begin{itemize}
\item Futz factor, time you loose using technologies by personal tasks
\item Reject to new technologies: this is complicated, this does not work, my boss only want to piss me off, this is worse
\begin{itemize}
 \item   Increase futz factor
\end {itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{FUD}
\begin{itemize}
\item To avoid FUD consecuences
\item Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt
\begin{itemize}
 \item   FLOSS is low-quality hacker-stuff,
 \item   FLOSS is viral; be very afraid,
 \item   FLOSS costs more, and
 \item   FLOSS will lower productivity somehow 
\end {itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{FUD}
\begin{itemize}
\item Some FUD examples
\item Microsoft and Openoffice. \url{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0lX0kShyL0}
\item Microsoft is a victim of OpenSource.
\begin{itemize}
