\section{Single-vendor vs. Community FLOSS}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Two management strategies in FLOSS projects and products:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item \textit{Single-vendor FLOSS}: Copyright owned by a single legal
entity willing to obtain direct revenues from FLOSS product.
   \item \textit{Community FLOSS}: Copyright owned by a community or
neutral legal entity representing the community. Stakeholders does not usually
get direct revenues, but through secondary products and services.
  \end{itemize}

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Examples}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Single-vendor FLOSS: RedHat, Mozilla software, MySQL.
  \item Community-owned FLOSS: GNOME projects, KDE projects, ASF projects.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Single-vendor FLOSS: revenue sources}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Core product.
  \item Whole product.
  \item Operational comfort.
  \item Consulting services.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Single-vendor also need a community}
\begin{itemize}
  \item FLOSS products without a strong community lead to centralized
development and support problems.
  \item Creating and engaging active communities around single-vendor FLOSS:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Free use.
   \item No lock-in.
   \item Self support
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Single-vendor: from community to benefits}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Once the single vendor has an active community around its products,
benefits come down the pipe:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Sales.
   \item Marketing.
   \item Product managment.
   \item Engineering.
   \item Support.
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Example of Single-vendor benefits: sales}
\begin{itemize}
  \item From ``Smoothing the On-ramp to Commercial'', by Larry Augustin.
  \item Single-vendor open source sales funnel (from customers perspective):
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item Download
   \item Install
   \item Use.
   \item Lead.
   \item Prospect
   \item Sale (customer).
  \end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The role of FLOSS foundations}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Steward of projects under its responsibility.
  \item Financial control, legal coverage and assessment.
  \item Positive added-values: Marketing, public image, negotiations...
  \item The foundation represents the community of developers: 
  \textit{community open source}.
\end{itemize}

 \item \textit{Law of conservation of attractive profits (Christensen, 2004)}
  \begin{center}
   \begin{quote}
    ``When attractive profits disappear at one stage in the value chain because 
a product becomes modular and commoditized, the opportunity to earn attractive profits 
with proprietary products will usually emerge at an adjacent stage.''
   \end{quote}
