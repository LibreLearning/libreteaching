\frametitle{Choosing a free license: previous criteria}

\begin{itemize}
\item Each project has its own goals and criteria related to licensing issues.
\item The \alert{main criterion} of differentiation is existence (or not) of \alert{reciprocity pacts}.
\item Other copyleft licenses have a limited effect, which applies only to the work (or component) original (``weak copyleft''). 
\item \alert{Dual licensing} policies.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Choosing a free license: When?}

\begin{itemize}
\item When we want to guarantee some basic freedoms, common to all free software.
\item When we want a work achieves the highest use and dissemination (permissive licenses).
\item When we want to maintain control over the evolution of the program (copyleft licenses).
\item When we impose certain conditions or restrictions (the recognition of authorship, copyleft, lack of liability, extra warranties, trademarks, etc.)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Do I want to allow privatization of derivative works?
\pause
\item Do I want developers return their modifications to the community, or me as original author, in particular?
\pause
\item Do I want to allow licensees to merge or link their program with mine?
\pause
\item Do I want widespread coverage, avoid any restriction and/or try to establish a standard?
\pause
\item Should my program run with one in particular? Have it any restrictions?

\frametitle{Remarks}

\begin{itemize}
\item Some members of the community refuse to accept GPL'ed source code into their projects.
\item Other members of the community strongly prefer GPL'ed source code over other licenses.
\item \alert{Nobody refuses} to accept code under \alert{permissive licenses} such as BSD, X11, MIT... 
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Remarks (2)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Almost nobody refuses to accept LGPL'ed code, except the Apache Foundation, saying that they think it would impose LGPL requirement upon the proprietary code (when they are linked via the Java class-loading mechanism).
\item The FSF disagrees with this statement, asserting that such linking falls under section 6 of the LGPLv2 (``linking exception'').
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Remarks (and 3)}

\begin{itemize}
\item MPL 1.1 can be specifically amended to allow combining with GPL (section 13).
\item You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, to sign a ``copyright disclaimer'' for the program, if necessary. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Applying a free license}

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{LICENSE} or \texttt{COPYING} file.
\item Copyright and license summary at the beginning of each source file.
\item It should have at least the ``copyright'' notice and a link to the full version of the license.
\item Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
\item If the program is interactive (terminal), make it output a short copyright notice 
when it starts in an interactive mode.
\item If it has a GUI, a menu can include copyright notice (or even the full license).
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Applying a free license}

\begin{itemize}
\item \alert{File-by-file method}: widely adopted in the free software community during the past two decades.
\item \alert{``Single COPYRIGHT file''} method (FSF preferred)
\item Question: advantages and disadvantages
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Below is an example license to be used for new code in OpenBSD,
modeled after the ISC license.
\item It is important to specify the year of the copyright.  Additional years
should be separated by a comma, e.g.
    Copyright (c) 2003, 2004
\item If you add extra text to the body of the license, be careful not to
add further restrictions.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Mixing GPL and BSD code just takes care}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify all contributors.
\item Identify which contributions create a copyright interest.
\item Secure permissions from current copyright holders.
\item Create a system for tracking permissions on future contributions.
\item Publicize the new licensing policy.
\end{enumerate}
                                                 
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Dual-licensing}

Distribute software under two different sets of terms and conditions. Motivations:

\begin{itemize}
\item License compatibility (Perl, Mozilla/Firefox, MySQL).
\item Market segregation based business models (MySQL Enterprise)
\item Allows the holder to offer customisations, early releases, generate other derivative works or grant rights to third parties to redistribute proprietary versions.
\end{itemize}
                                                 
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Dual-licensed under the GPL and a permissive license?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Developers sometimes attempt to explicitly dual licensing to be available under permissive terms as well as to be incorporable into GPL'd projects.
\item But developers should simply use the permissive license without any further reference to the GPL (Software Freedom Law Center).
\end{itemize}
                                                 
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Compatibility}

\begin{itemize}
\item Two licenses are incompatible if it is not possible combining both works in compliance with the terms of  both licenses at the same time. 
\item It affects to distribution, not the use. 
\item If two licenses are free does, it doesn't imply are compatible. 
\item Copyleft licenses are mutually incompatible, unless compatibility is declared explicitly. 
\item Support for `` linking'': even if not allowed mix or integrate software with different licenses, maybe it can be linked. 
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Forking (1)}

\begin{itemize}
\item A piece of software is modified and developed separately by another team development, and distributed under a different name, and maybe other
license.
\item The forks can be possible \alert{only} with free/open source software.
\item The GPL software has tendency to avoid forking (we must keep the original license).
\item The BSD-style licenses are forked easily.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Forking (and 2)}

\begin{itemize}
\item \alert{Forkaphobia}: Soma people consider forking a bad thing (waste efforts, bitter disputes...).
\item But there are successful cases: XOrg/XFree86, 386BSD, OpenBSD, Gnu-Emacs/XEmacs, changes of license (GForge, OpenSSH).
\item If forking is easy, experimentation with ideas can be pursued while still remaining downstream.
\item But if forking is difficult, experimenters are reduced to dissenters (resulting in divorce). 
\item \alert{Forking paradox}: ``the easier it is to fork the software, the more difficult it is to fork the community'' (Bryan Cantrill)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Licenses and warranty}

\begin{itemize}
\item Warranty disclaimers and limitation of liability clauses are common in software.
\item There are legal doubts about the effectiveness of these clauses: \alert{would not apply to consumers}.
\item This clauses are valid when there is \alert{no commercial service}.
\item The proprietary licenses using similar terms: is a myth to accept greater responsibility.
\item It must be considered legal guarantees that apply to both open source and proprietary software.
\item The free licenses allow (sometimes) to add extra warranty clauses.
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Anti-patterns: mistakes (B. Cantrill)}

\begin{itemize}
\item No source! Don't do this: you gain nothing and you lose credibility (perhaps forever). Ex. HP webOS
\item Forkaphobia: FOSS that cannot be forked has no vitality.
\item Governance orgy (constitutions, elections...): corrosive effects, factionalize and undermine community. 
\item Competitive paranoia: companies that adopt your technology \alert{are not your competitors}!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Anti-collaborative licensing?}

\begin{itemize}
\item \alert{Competitive paranoia}: anti-collaborative licensing erect walls \alert{within} open source software.
\item Strong copyleft (and affero clauses) excludes competitors... \alert{but also collaborators}! It prevents cross-polinization across open source code bases! 
\item And prevent integration of FLOSS technologies! (ex. DTrace, ZFS and Linux).
\item If you want a collaborative copyleft license, \alert{consider weak copyleft} (MPL, CDDL, LGPL...).
\end{itemize}
