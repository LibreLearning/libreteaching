\subsection{Academic licenses}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{BSD License}

Origins:
\begin{itemize}
\item BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) is a Unix flavor developed
  by University of Berkeley (CA).
\item BSD Unix was licensed under a ``minimalistic'' license which
  permits both source or binary redistribution; also modifications,
  but without any other restriction.
\item Several revisions: it's a \textit{template}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{BSD License}

\begin{itemize}
\item Based in original BSD license.
\item Very popular (BSD userland, PF, TCP/IP, OpenSSH, TCL/Tk...).
\item You may redistribute the work, in any form (source or binary)
  but with all remaining copyright notes (authorship attribution).
\item There is a ``no warranty'' clause. 
BSD: No restrictions on future behavior. 
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{BSD License. Advantages}

\begin{itemize}
\item BSD license places minimal restrictions on future behavior.
\item This allows BSD code to remain Open Source or become integrated into commercial solutions.
\item No legal complexity (unlike GPL or LGPL licenses). 
\item It allows developers and companies to spend their time creating and promoting good code rather than worrying if that code violates licensing.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Public Domain}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Public domain}. An intellectual work in the public domain
  is neither under any IP law nor a license. 
\item Most public domain works retains the authorship. 
\item With source code available, it's very similar to have the program under a BSD license.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Permissive licenses}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Apache License v2 (1)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Old versions: 1.0 (original) and 1.1 (ASF, 2000).
\item An extension of the 3-clause BSD license.
\item Apache License 2.0 (January 2004): permissive license.
\item Make the license easier for non-ASF projects to use.
\item Explicitly grants patent rights where necessary to operate, modify and distribute the software.
\item Permits to be integrated into closed source projects.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Apache License v2 (and 2)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Over 5000 non-ASF projects located at SourceForge are available under Apache License (2009). 
\item 25\% from Google Code (including Android).
\item Compatibility with GPLv3 (only one-way). 
\item Incompatible with GPLv2.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Weak copyleft licenses}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Mozilla Public License v1.1}

\begin{itemize}
\item It keeps the covered code itself open source.
\item Code under the MPL may be combined with proprietary files in one program (``Larger Work'').
\item Explicitly grants patent rights where necessary to operate the software.
\item A module covered by the GPL and a module covered by the MPL cannot legally be linked together.
\item For this reason, Firefox have been relicensed under multiple licenses (MPL, GPL, LGPL).

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The GNU LGPL v2.1}

\begin{center}
LGPL = Lesser GPL
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item LGPL started as ``Library GPL''. Later renamed to ``Lesser
  GPL''.
\item LGPL maintain all GPL provisions, but with one exception:
\begin{itemize}
  \item ``Works that use the library'' \alert{can be licensed any way} (including proprietary software).
  \item Not only libraries: OpenOffice, Mozilla.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{LGPL linking exception}
\begin{block}{LGPL linking exception}
``A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a ``work that uses the Library''. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.''

\end{block}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why LGPL?}


\begin{itemize}
\item Created for promoting the use of free software libraries (ex: GNU libc --glibc--).
\item Later, FSF checked that LGPL was very used, so they decided to rename it 
  to ``lesser'' and discourage its use (v2.1, 1999).
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\subsection{Strong copyleft licenses}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{GNU GPL License}

\begin{center}
\item GPL = GNU General Public License.
\end{center}

GPL Concepts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Created by FSF for the GNU Project.
\item Very often used in non-GNU free software.
\item Probably, the most popular Free Software license: around 70\%
  Freshmeat projects licensed under GPL.
\item Some popular software licensed under GPL: Linux, GNOME, Emacs,
 GCC\ldots
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The GNU GPL}

What makes the GPL so special?
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item It was the first license to outline the copyleft principle.
\item All copyleft licenses have been based on the GPL, including the Wikipedia license.
\item Without the GPL, copyleft would be just an idea. 
\item Designed to prevent the proprietary commercialization of free software code.
\item The GPL is a ``viral'' copyleft license: not business friendly.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{GNU GPL License (II)}

GPL Characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
\item This license guarantees the four FLOSS freedoms.
\item It is though to always guarantee code freedom. This is the
  meaning of the ``copyleft'' clause: all derivative works should be
  licensed also under the same license.
\item Since in USA software patents are admissible, GPL includes a
  clause for avoiding GPL licensing of patented software or
  algorithms.
\item GPL has three versions. The most known is GPL Version 2 because
  has been on the market for more than 10 years. 
\item GPL code can not be mixed with other code under
  ``GPL-incompatible'' license.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{GPL versions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Based in Emacs license, first copyleft license (1986).
\item GPL version 1 (1989). Generics, program-independent, ``version 1 or later''.
\item GPL version 2 (1991). ``Liberty or dead'' clause (it prevents from patents threats).
\item GPL version 3 (2007). Tivoization, patents and DRMs. Community discuss.
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{GPL, version 2 (GPLv2)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Written by Richard Stallman and the FSF. It was published in 1991.
    \item The most popular free software license: It covers 50-70 \% of all free software.
    \item It's more than a software license: it is a social contract.


\end{itemize}

\pause

{\centerline{\large \alert{Why does it update it?}}}

\pause

After 15 years, needed updating in order to remain effective against the technological challenges.
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{GPLv3 elaboration process}

Public consultation process:
\begin{itemize}
\item It lasted eighteen months: from January 16, 2006 (first draft) to June 29, 2007 (final version).
\item Four drafts. 
\item Five International Conferences (Boston, Porto Alegre, Barcelona, Tokyo and Brussels)
\end{itemize}

\pause

The most important change, compared to previous versions, was the re-elaboration of the license, since it was discussed and agreed by the community.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Changes in GPLv3}
The newest GPL version does not invalidate previous versions or requires software to be licensed under the new version.
\begin{itemize}
\item Major changes
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It DOES NOT prevent DRM implementations with GPL software, but it DOES allow interoperable software to be written with it.
        \item {More protection related to software patents}
        \item It neutralizes WIPO (\textit{anti-circumvention}) laws which ban libre software (DMCA and EUCD).
        \item It clarifies license compatibility (additional permissions)
    \end{itemize}
\item Minor changes
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Adaptation to technological innovations.
        \item Clarifications to make it easier to use and understand.
        \item Better internationalization (\textit{convey/distribution})
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\pause

Many changes, but fundamental principles remain.

\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{GPLv3: Digital Rights Management (DRM)}

How GPLv3 works:

\begin{itemize}
\item Neutralize laws that prohibit (write or share) libre software (such as DMCA, EUCD)
\item But not forbidding DRM with GPLed software.
\item It's always possible to use GPLed code to write software that implements DRM 
\item But it's possible write interoperable software and bypass restrictions. 
\item Neutralize tivoization: require to provide with information or necessary data to install modified software on the embedded device.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{GNU GPL does not restrict what people do in software; it just stops them from restricting others.}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{GPLv3: Software Patents}
Protection against patent threats is implemented in GPLv2 through clause ``Liberty or Death'' (sec. 7).

\begin{itemize}
\item If GPLed code includes patents with incompatible restrictions, can't be distributed.
\item Avoid ``zombie'' libre software (software would be free if patents won't exist anymore).
\end{itemize}

{\centerline{This clause remains in GPLv3.}}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{GPLv3: Protecting From Anti-Circumvention Law}
Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law (sec. 3):

\begin{block}{GPLv3, Section 3. Protecting From Anti-Circumvention}
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure. [...]      When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of
technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights
under this License 
 \end{block}


\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Software Patents}
GPLv3 adds stronger protection against patent threats through legal-engineering:

\begin{itemize}
\item Who distribute GPLed software must provide any patent rights to exercise the freedoms that the GPL grants him.
\item If anyone intends to exercise a patent, your license is finished.
\item Users and developers can work with GPLv3 software without worrying about anybody can sue for patent infringement.
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Compatibility}

Compatibility == merge source code from different libre software licenses.

\begin{itemize}
\item GPLv3 increases compatibility with several free licenses (Apache, Affero).
\item Allow additional requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Responsibility: Allows add disclaimers or warranty notes.
\item Allows add restrictions about trademarks.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

GPLv3 is more modular, more compatible, and will be compatible with different copyleft licenses.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{GPL caveats (1)}

\begin{itemize}
\item If GPL source is required for a program to compile, the program must be under the GPL. 
\item Linking statically to a GPL library requires a program to be under the GPL.
\item GPL requires that any patents associated with GPLed software must be licensed for everyone's free use.
\item Simply aggregating software together (i.e. distros) does not count as including GPLed programs in non-GPLed programs.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{GPL caveats (and 2)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Output of a program does not count as a derivative work. This enables the gcc compiler to be used in commercial environments without legal problems.
\item Since the Linux kernel is under the GPL, any code statically linked with the Linux kernel must be GPLed. 
\item This requirement can be circumvented by dynamically linking loadable kernel modules. Disadvantage: they will only work for particular versions of the Linux kernel.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Other reciprocal licenses: Affero GPL (AGPL)}

\begin{itemize}
\item It is a \alert{derived} license from GPL. 
\item Published by the Free Software Foundation (version 3: 2007).
\item It contains a clause requiring distribution of any modified source code of applications \alert{running over a network} (SaaS).
\item It aims to cover the case of modified GPL software which is not distributed because the GPL license does not require to do so (web services or online applications). 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is a derivative work}

\begin{itemize}
\item A work based upon a preexisting work.
\item The preexisting work is modified, translated, recasted, 
transformed, adapted so to create an improved (or different) work.
\item \alert{Substantial similarity}: it's not enough to identify a derivated software work. 
\item Complex problem... only related to copyleft?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is a derivative work}

\begin{itemize}
\item  Is Linux a derivative work of Unix?
\item Is implementation of a industry standard a derivative work of that specification?
\item How much copying of source code is required to create a derivative work?
\item Does linking create a derivative work?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is a derivative work: linking}

\begin{itemize}
\item FSF \textit{doctrine}
\item Copyright law and linking (What about web pages?)
\item Translate, modify, revisions... are derivative works. But it's not linking that made the difference!
\item Output data (compiling)
\item Pipes vs. code
\item Copyright holder (not FSF!) and judge: valid meaning. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Discussion: GPL vs BSD}

\begin{itemize}
\item ``BSD code is free, but GPL code stays free.'' 

\pause

\item Copyleftism: (Not) business friendly? 

\end{itemize}
