\section{Grading plan}

Each activity contributing to the grading of the course has its own evaluation criteria, as described below. Each of these activities has a minimum and maximum grading. If the minimum grading is 0, the activity is optional. Otherwise, the activity is mandatory, and has to be graded al least with the minimum to pass the course. Each activity has also a description, and when possible, some general grading criteria. In any case, the final grade for the course will also depend on the continuous observation of the instructors on the outcomes and progress of students.

Students should ask instructors about any detail which may not be clear to them, either about the general grading plan, or about specific aspects of the activities. As a general rule, evaluation will have into account how the activity and its results show that the student has come close to the competences, knowledge and skills expected for the course.

The student can consider that the next table will be used as a (minimum) guideline for assigning marks:

\begin{itemize}
\item Pass (``aprobado''): 150
\item Good (``notable''): 250
\item Excellent (``sobresaliente): 350
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Exercises (answered in forum)}. \\
  Minimum: 20 points, maximum: 100 points.

  Exercises proposed and answered in the the forum of the course.

\item \textbf{Blog entries}. \\
  Minimum: 20 points, maximum: 80 points

  Blog entries specifically related to the course, and marked as such. The tag used for that is mswl-eco.

\item \textbf{Collaborative notebook}. \\
  Minimum: 0 points, maximum: 40 points

  Based on work in class (in real time) and afterwards (complementing the work, using git).

\item \textbf{Business plan}. \\
  Minimum: 20 points, maximum: 80 points

  Business plan for a company in which libre software clearly has an impact. The plan has to be detailed enough

\item \textbf{Specific report}. \\
  Minimum: 20 points, maximum: 80 points

Specific report about a certain business model or strategy based on FLOSS, showing its general aspects, but also analyzing companies already putting it into place, discussing advantages and drawbacks of the model, etc. A detailed DAFO analysis has to be a part of the report.

\begin{itemize}
\item A `traditional' written report.
\item A video or audio presentation (10 min. maximum).
\item A set of slides supporting the presentation.
\end{itemize}

 It is important to detail all the references, and to heavily root the report on data and/or specific works publicly available.

\item \textbf{Other activities}. \\
  Minimum: 0 points, maximum: 100 points

  These activities have to be agreed in advance with the instructors.
\end{itemize}

%%----------------------------------------------------------------
%%----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{01 - Introduction and motivation}


%%----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Statements about economic aspects of libre software}
\label{sub:statements-eco}

Review of 10 statements about economic aspects of FLOSS. They could be true, or not, or arguable. Working in groups, prepare and consolidate your answers collaboratively. Each group can ellaborate in more detail about 2-3 statements, but should comment on all of them.

\textbf{Supporting material}

\begin{itemize}
\item Slides ``10 statements about economic aspects of FLOSS''
\end{itemize}

%%----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Comments on ``Yochai Benkler on the new open source economics''}
\label{sub:comments-benkler}

Benkler presents a diagram showing different positions for product or services according to the type of management (centralized/decentralized) and economic profitability (market/non-market). He characterizes all his examples in this presentation falling in the non-market/decentralized space. Find counterexamples of enterprises like crowdspring, making economic profit from a decentralized, crowdsourced platform (if possible, outside the FLOSS sector).

\end{itemize}

%%----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Discussion of ``The new (commercial) open source''}
\label{sub:new-oss}

\end{itemize}

%%----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Numbers about libre software use and deployment}
\label{sub:numbers-use}

Look for numbers showing quantitatively the usage or deployment of libre software. Those can represent market shares, number of users, number of companies, etc. They can refer to a market niche, to a country or region, or even to a company or public administration; to a specific point in time, or to evolution over several years. They can be only numbers, but of course can also be graphs or other representations of the data.

%%----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Free software and R\&D Institutes}
\label{sub:openinnova-rd}

After the presentation by Sergio Ramos about CeDInt-UPM, and its challenges when considering open innovation strategies, and based on it and your own experience and your knowledge of free software communities and projects, please ellaborate on either:

\begin{itemize}
\item How could an R&D Institute adapt some of the innovation practices found in free software projects and communities.
\item How could an R&D Institute use free software as an integral part of an open innovation strategy.
\end{itemize}


%%----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Cases of free software and open innovation}
\label{sub:openinnova-cases}

Find some more cases of free software and open innovation, and try to classify them according to the categories discussed in the slides (the West-Gallagher models of open innovation with free software). Discuss any of them.


%%----------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Charles Leadbeater on innovation}
\label{sub:openinnova-cases}
