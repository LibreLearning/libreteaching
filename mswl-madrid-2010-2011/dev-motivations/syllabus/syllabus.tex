\section{Grading plan}

Each activity contributing to the grading of the course has its own evaluation criteria, 
as described below. Each of these activities has a minimum and maximum grading. If the 
minimum grading is 0, the activity is \textit{optional}. Otherwise, the activity is \textit{mandatory}, and 
has to be graded al least with the minimum to pass the course. Each activity has also a 
description, and when possible, some general grading criteria. In any case, the final grade 
for the course will also depend on the continuous observation of the instructors on the 
outcomes and progress of students.

Students should ask instructors about any detail which may not be clear to them, 
either about the general grading plan, or about specific aspects of the activities. 
As a general rule, evaluation will have into account how the activity and its results 
show that the student has come close to the competences, knowledge and skills expected 
for the course.

The student can consider that the next table will be used as a (minimum) guideline for 
assigning marks:

\begin{itemize}
\item Pass (``aprobado''): 150
\item Good (``notable''): 250
\item Excellent (``sobresaliente): 350
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Graded activities}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Exercises (answered in forum)}. \\
  Minimum: 20 points, maximum: 100 points.

  Exercises proposed and answered in the the forum of the course.

\item \textbf{Blog entries}. \\
  Minimum: 20 points, maximum: 80 points

  Blog entries specifically related to the course, and marked as such. The tag used for that is mswl-intro.

\item \textbf{Collaborative notebook}. \\
  Minimum: 0 points, maximum: 40 points

  Based on work in class (in real time) and afterwards (complementing the work, using git).

\item \textbf{Specific report on leadership}. \\
  Minimum: 20 points, maximum: 140 points

  Specific written report (5-10 pages) about a prominent leader in FLOSS. An initial list of candidate profiles to choose
from will be published in short on the course website. It is important to detail all the references, and to 
heavily root the report on data and/or specific works publicly available.

  Some aspects that must be considered include:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Biography and relevant details to contextualize their contributions in FLOSS.
   \item Annotated description of the evolution of the FLOSS project they lead, or have led in the past.
   \begin{itemize}
    \item Founder? Arrived lately?
    \item If possible, try to quantify their contributions (number of commits, bug fixes or other relevant 
    activities to boost the project).
    \item Is this person still leading the project? If that is not the case, why did he/she left?
    \item Was he/she essential for the success of the project or the surrounding community? Why?
   \end{itemize}

   \item It is possible that they have lead more than one project. Then, students can either focus on just
   one of these projects or enlighten the transitions between projects and their reasons.
   \item A thorough description of the main leadership traits exhibited by the analyzed figure is essential.
  \end{itemize}


\item \textbf{Other activities}. \\
  Minimum: 0 points, maximum: 100 points

  These activities have to be agreed with the instructors.
\end{itemize}
