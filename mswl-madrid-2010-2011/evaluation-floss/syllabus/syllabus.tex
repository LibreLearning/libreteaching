\subsection{Session 2 (Thursday, November 25, 2010)}

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Lecturers}: Felipe Ortega and Pedro Coca.

 \item \textbf{Content}:

 \begin{itemize}
      \item Activity:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Create a collaborative document where important aspect of the libre software world
          have not been taken in previous quality models seen in session 1. This document should 
          be updated with new ideas during the rest of the subject.
        \end{itemize}
      \item Introduction to OpenBRR
      \item Activity: 
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Divided students in groups of two/three people and work on a specified quality attribute from OpenBRR
          in a given libre software project.
          \item Students, should later aggregate all the results in a final spreadsheet with all the results.
        \end{itemize}
       \item Introduction to QSoS

\section{Grading plan}

Each activity contributing to the grading of the course has its own evaluation criteria, as described below. Each of these activities has a minimum and maximum grading. If the minimum grading is 0, the activity is optional. Otherwise, the activity is mandatory, and has to be graded at least with the minimum to pass the course. Each activity has also a description, and when possible, some general grading criteria. In any case, the final grade for the course will also depend on the continuous observation of the instructors on the outcomes and progress of students.

Students should ask instructors about any detail which may not be clear to them, either about the general grading plan, or about specific aspects of the activities. As a general rule, evaluation will have into account how the activity and its results show that the student has come close to the competences, knowledge and skills expected for the course.

The student can consider that the next table will be used as a (minimum) guideline for assigning marks:

\begin{itemize}
\item Pass (``aprobado''): 120
\item Good (``notable''): 250
\item Excellent (``sobresaliente): 350
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Exercises (answered in forum)}. \\
  Minimum: 20 points, maximum: 100 points.

  Exercises proposed and answered in the the forum of the course.

\item \textbf{Blog entries}. \\
  Minimum: 20 points, maximum: 80 points

  Blog entries specifically related to the course, and marked as such. The tag used for that is mswl-eval.

\item \textbf{Quality. Case Study. Libre SCM Tools: Bazaar, Mercurial and Git}. \\
  Minimum: 0 points, maximum: 100 points

\item \textbf{Other activities}. \\
  Minimum: 0 points, maximum: 100 points

\end{itemize}
