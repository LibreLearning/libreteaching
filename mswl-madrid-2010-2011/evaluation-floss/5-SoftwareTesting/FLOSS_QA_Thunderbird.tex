  \item Fill the info in the form to tell Mozilla about this crash so they can fix it.
  \item Mozilla Crash Reporter will send a summary of the crash to Mozilla.
  \item Restart your application!
  \item Referencing crash reports in bugzilla is a good idea, just add the GGUID to the bug, when reporting a bug that cause a crash!
