 \item Implementation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Client integration to handle crash reporting 
        \item Server (Socorro) that collects and processes collected crash data
        \item A web interface (Socorro) for viewing and parsing crash reports, called
        \item This info is used by Thunderbird developers to make future versions crash less frequently.

        \item Also used in other Mozilla products (Firefox, etc).

 \frametitle{How to use the crash reporter}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item The Crash Reporter appears only when Thunderbird crashes.
  \item Only when Thunderbird crashes, it doesn't cause Thunderbird to crash!, like some people think.
  \item Once it has appeared, it saves a binary "dump" file, with a lot of info about the crash.
  \item Fill the info in the form to tell Mozilla about this crash so they can fix it.
  \item Mozilla Crash Reporter will send a summary of the crash to Mozilla.
  \item Restart your application!
  \item Referencing crash reports in bugzilla is a good idea, just add the GGUID to the bug, when reporting a bug that cause a crash!
