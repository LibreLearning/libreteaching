\section{Introduction to Risk Management}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Management: Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item The aim of security is to protect the company/entity and its assets
\item Risk management
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Identifies these assets
  \item Point to the threats putting them in peril
  \item Estimates the potential loss and harm if the threat becomes reality
  \item Identify action plans to mitigate those risks
  \item Provide an economic balance between the safeguard implemented and the impact of the threat
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Security Management: Definitions}
\begin{itemize}

\item Vulnerability
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Absence or weakness of a safeguard
  \item Is a HW or SW weakness that may provide an attacker a way to compromise our (CIA) system.
  \item Could be an open port, unpatched applications, unrestriced modem dial-in access, no physical security, etc,
  \end{itemize}
\item Threat
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Any event that causes an undesirable impact on our organisation.
  \item Any potential danger to the system or to the information.
  \item Could be a Tsunami, an unintentional mistake leading to confidential data exposure, a process reading data violating our data policy, etc
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Security Management: Definitions}
\begin{itemize}

\item Risk
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Is the probability of a threat agent exploiting a vulnerability and the corresponding business impact
  \item Potential lost or harm to a system.
  \item If there is no IDS, the risk (likelihood) of unnoticed attacks would be high
  \item If there is no awareness training, the risk of unintentional mistakes causing information deletion/exposure would be high
  \end{itemize}
\item Exposure
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Is an instance of being exposed to harm or lost from an entity that takes advantage of a vulnerability
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Security Management: Definitions}
\begin{itemize}

\item Safeguard
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Is the countermeasure to put in place to mitigate the potential risk
  \item Could be a procedure, a piece of HW or SW, etc
  \item Access Controls, strong password management policies, awareness training, etc
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Security Management: Risk Management}
\begin{itemize}

\item Information Risk Management (IRM)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The prime objective of security controls is to reduce effects of theats and vulnerabilities to a level that is tolerable
  \item We have to implement the right mechanism to set and keep that level of risk
  \end{itemize}
\item Types of Risk
  \begin{itemize}
  \item There are many risk categories: Physical damage, Human interaction, Equipment malfunction, Inside and ouside attacks, Misuse of data, Loss of data and Application errors.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Security Management: Risk Analysis}
\begin{itemize}

\item Risk Analysis Objectives
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Identify assets and their values
  \item Identify vulnerabilities and threats 
  \item Quantifying the probability and business impact of these potential threats
  \item Provide an economic balance between the impact of the threat and the cost of the countermeasure 
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Security Management: Risk Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item Risk Analysis can take two approaches:
\item {\bf Quantitative} Risk Analysis 
\item {\bf Qualitative} Risk Analysis 
\item Each approach has advantages and disadvantages
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Security Management: Risk Analysis}
\begin{itemize}

\item Risk Analysis Steps
  \begin{itemize}

  \item Carry out a threat analysis
  \item Derive the Overall Loss Potential per Threat
  \item Reduce, Transfer or Accept the risk
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Security Management: Risk Analysis}
\begin{itemize}

\item Value of Assets
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Quantitative and Qualitative measures 
  \item The actual value of an asset is determined by the cost to acquire, develop and maintain it.
  \item Value of the asset to owners and users
  \item Value of the asset to competitors
  \item Intelectual property issues
  \item Liability issues (Data protection)
  \item It is critical to take into account the business impact!
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Introduction to Access Control}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Access Control Definition}

\begin{itemize}
\item Set of procedures perfomed by hardware, software and administrative items
\item Aimed to:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Monitor access
   \item Identify user requesting access
   \item Record access attepmpts
   \item Grant or deny access based on a pre-established rules
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Access Control Principles}

\begin{itemize}
\item As we have just seen, the three main principles for any type of control are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Confidentiality
\item Integrity
\item Availability
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Access Control Models: MAC}

\begin{itemize}
\item Mandatory Access Control
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Subjects have a {\bf clearance}
    \item Objects have a {\bf classification}
    \item Subjects must have a {\bf need to know} over the Objects
    \item Subjects can access Objects with the same or below clearance level and a need to know for the Objects
    \item Rule-based access control is a type of MAC (access is not based on identity)
    \item Unclassified, confidential, secret and top secret {\bf sensitivity}
    \item SELinux, TrustedBSD are examples of Free OS implementing MAC
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Access Control Models: DAC}

\begin{itemize}
\item Discretionary Access Control
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The subject can specify (with limitations) what objects are accessible
    \item Access Control Lists (ACL) can be set up
    \item ACL shows what subjects can use what objects with what privileges
    \item Common Unix system of users, groups, and read-write-execute permissions
    \item Identity-based access controls
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Access Control Models: Non DAC}

\begin{itemize}
 
\item Non-Discretionary Access Control
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Also known as Role-based access control (RBAC)
    \item Assigning a user to a role is imposed (Always)
    \item A central Authority determines access between subjects and objects
    \item Access controls can be role-based or task-based
    \item These kind of control do not need to be updated if there is a role change in the company
    \item is RBAC a type of MAC?
       \begin{itemize}
       \item \url{http://csrc.nist.gov/rbac}
       \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Access Control Models Wrap up}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf MAC}: Operating Systems, using security labels, enforce the model and therefore ther securiy system
\item {\bf DAC}: Data owners decide which subjects has access to which objects
\item {\bf RBAC}: Access to objects is determined by the role of each subject
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Access Control Types}

\begin{itemize}
\item Preventive (Inhibit)
\item Detective (Discover)
\item Corrective (Restoring)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Access Control Implementation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Access Controls can be implemented with a set of measures:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Administrative}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Policies, procedures, staff training, reviews.
    \end{itemize}
\item {\bf Logical/Technical}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item ACL, Firewalls, Smart Card Access, Encryption, etc
    \end{itemize}
\item {\bf Physical}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Server Facilities locking, backing up, cable protection, etc
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Access Control Attacks}

\begin{itemize}

\item Denial of Service
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Compromises the availability
  \item Buffer Overflows, SYN Attack, etc
  \item Authorisation
  \end{itemize}
\item Back Door
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Bypasses access control mechanisms
  \end{itemize}
\item Spoofing, Man in the Middle, Session Hijacking, Social Engineering.
\item Dumpster diving
\item Password guessing, Brute Force, Dictionary Attacks
\item Software exploits, Trojan Horses, etc

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Access Accountability}

\begin{itemize}
\item Access Controls provide Access Accountability 
\item Access Accountability needs:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Identification
  \item Authentication
  \item Authorisation
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Identification, Authentication and Authorisation}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Identification} sets a method of ensuring that a user, program or process (any subject) is the entity it claims to be.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Usernames, Account numbers are ways to identify a subject
  \end{itemize}
\item {\bf Authentication} is the fact of confirming an identity claim made by or about the subject
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Passwords, PINs, Criptographic key, etc are usually authentication methods
  \end{itemize}
\item {\bf Authorisation} is the procedure of specifying access rights to a set of resources
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Usually the system checks an access control matrix or an ACL
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Strong Authentication}

\begin{itemize}

\item There are 3 general aspects to prove be authenticated:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Something you {\bf KNOW}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Usually a PIN, password, etc
    \item Easy and cheap to implement
    \end{itemize}
  \item Something you {\bf HAVE}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Usually a key, a badge, etc
    \item Normally used for physical access, but can be required for logical access
    \end{itemize}
  \item Something you {\bf ARE}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Biometrics
    \item Complex and expensive implementation.
    \item False positives/negatives (Type I/II errors). Crossover rate
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item {\bf Strong Authentication} contains 2 out of 3 aspects. Also know as {\bf two-factor authentication}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Passwords}

\begin{itemize}
\item Most common authentication method: User id bound with a reusable password.
\item Also weakest method!
\item Therefore, usually access control relies on password strength
\item Becomes very important the password management policy
\item Is an important target in attacks
\item Tools to analise the targeted social network profiles to create custom dicts
\item Tools to create non-dictionary tipical human variations
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Password gathering techniques}

\begin{itemize}
\item Monitoring
\item Accessing the password file
\item Brute force attacks
\item Dictionary attacks
\item Social engineering
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Password protection measures}

\begin{itemize}
\item Set a clipping Level (user will locked out for a fixed time)
\item Limit the number of failed logon attempts
\item Awareness training
\item Password checkers
\item Password hashing and Encryption
\item Password aging
\item Cognitive passwords
\item One-Time passwords  (dinamic passwords)
\item Token devices
